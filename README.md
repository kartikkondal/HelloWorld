This is my first repository through the GitHub guide.Thank You

So i was trying to learn Github from Udemy and Youtube but the videos were so long and tiering 
so i decided to leave it there for some time and then finally by the grace of god i got 
the Github guide at the top of the GitHub account and i am very happy to learn it in such a short and easy way
